\subsection{problem and objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item assemble to order for capacity planning
  \item 3\%, 5\%, 3 min C\&R-App
\end{itemize}

\subsection{literature}
\begin{itemize}
  \item TAKT
  \item OpSysTra
\end{itemize}

\subsection{innovation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item first infrastructure manager to use optimization models for freight train timetable planning
  \item customer value: shorter travel time, higher infrastructure capacity and faster response time
  \item first fully automated process in short-term capacity planning from ordering to the actual departure of the train
\end{itemize}

\subsection{data}
\begin{itemize}
  \item digital infrastructure model
  \item timetable of passenger trains
\end{itemize}

\subsection{practical relevance}
\begin{itemize}
  \item release of C\&R-App in 2019 \\
  As explained earlier the C\&R-App gives the cargo customer a valid timetable after an average of three minutes. As for now the app is working as design. However, the app is not used by the customer yet since it is still in a evaluation phase where bugs can be find and be fixed. \\
  Nevertheless this situation changes next year as the release of the C\&R-App is planned next year. This has an extremely impact of the timetable procedure since then the customer gets his timetable within three minutes. Today a short-term creation of a timetable takes up to 72
  hours, since we have to take all the details of the construction of one train into account and the creation of a timetable is done manually. Therefore customer order there timetable a long time ahead even if they don't exactly know whether they need the timetable at the requested time or not. For example when goods are relaoded from a ship to a train. Here, it is really hard to find out when the goods are exactly on the train and therefore the ordered timetable does not fit to the actuall time anymore. But since the customer ordered a timetable we have to dispose the train through our network which makes the network unstable. \\
  As a conlusiion the new App gives not only the customer a chance to actually to stick on there timetable it also gives us better data for the construction of a timetable. \\
  As you can see our solution is not only academic it also solves real world problems since x\% of the customer requests can me answered automatically. \\
  
  What we want to do in the future. \\
  We want to give the customer thr possibiblity to select within three different timetables to give him more options what kind of timetbabe he want. \\
  Furthermore after going live with the C\&R-App we also want to enrole the automatic planning of the "Netzfahrplan" which does the timetable of the cargo trains automtically for one year and the planning of the "Baufahrplan" which reschedule the cargo trains due to constructions. \\
  This next steps do not come all at one time. Since we want to learn how the customer react to the new procedure and we want to have the chance to change the things the customer complain about. With this way we can come together with our customer to a better quality of the timetable. \\
  
  This new way of the construction of the cargo train timetable prepares DB Netz for the future with an increased efficiency since we have less effort for staff and customer. We are not only more efficient with the planning of timetable we also have a higher capacity utilization of the infrastructure and we are able to offer our cargo customer a better timetable since the customer reaches there destination ealier.   \\
