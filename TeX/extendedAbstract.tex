\label{chap:extAbs}

\subsection{problem and objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item assemble to order for capacity planning
  \item 3\%, 5\%, 3 min C\&R-App
\end{itemize}

\subsection{literature}
\begin{itemize}
  \item TAKT
  \item OpSysTra
\end{itemize}

\subsection{innovation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item first infrastructure manager to use optimization models for freight train timetable planning
  \item customer value: shorter travel time, higher infrastructure capacity and faster response time
  \item first fully automated process in short-term capacity planning from ordering to the actual departure of the train
\end{itemize}

\subsection{data}
\begin{itemize}
  \item digital infrastructure model
  \item timetable of passenger trains
\end{itemize}

\subsection{practical relvance}
\begin{itemize}
  \item release of C\&R-App in 2019
  \item first step in automization of timetable planning and traffic management
  \item prepares DB Netz for the future with an increased efficiency (higher capacity and less effort for staff and customers)
\end{itemize}
